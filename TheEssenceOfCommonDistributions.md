# The essence of common distributions

#### Poisson distribution

Poisson distribution models the number of poisson points in a specific space or time interval. The  number goes from $0$ to $\infty$.

The meaning of $\lambda$ is the mean and **frequency**. For example, if this poisson distribution is about the number of calls in time interval with $30$ minutes, and the **relative frequency** is $2$ calls per minute, then $\lambda= 2 \times 30$.

#### Exponential distribution

Exponential distribution models the waiting time between two poisson points.
